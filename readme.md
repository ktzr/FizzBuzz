# FizzBuzz

It's a famous programming challenge/question.

We have all given it a go at least once in our life.
You might even have been asked it in an interview.

I'm starting from the worst implementation I can think of and making small changes to improve it, set by step.

## What Is FizzBuzz
Its a game made to teach children about, and practice division.

You sit in a circle and incrementally count from 1 to 100, you say a number then the person next to you says the next number.

**But**
- If a number is divisible by 3 you say `Fizz`
- If a number is divisible by 5 you say `Buzz`
- If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5 you say `FizzBuzz`


## Why Did You Write This?
To be honest im not 100% sure.

I started because I want to see how many FizzBuzz implementations I could come up with.
But realised, most implementations follow the same principals, or are slight improvements on each other.

I thought, "Why not structure it as a tutorial, mabey someone will find it useful?". So I did.
