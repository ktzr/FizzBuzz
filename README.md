# FizzBuzz

It's a famous programming challenge/question.

We have all given it a go at least once in our life.
You might even have been asked it in an interview.

I'm starting from the worst implementation I can think of and making small changes to improve it, set by step.

See the code in [fizzbuzz.py](fizzbuzz.py)

## What Is FizzBuzz
Its a game made to teach children about, and practice division.

You sit in a circle and incrementally count from 1 to 100, you say a number then the person next to you says the next number.

**But**
- If a number is divisible by 3 you say `Fizz`
- If a number is divisible by 5 you say `Buzz`
- If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5 you say `FizzBuzz`


## Why Did You Write This?
To be honest im not 100% sure.

I started because I want to see how many FizzBuzz implementations I could come up with.
But realised, most implementations follow the same principals, or are slight improvements on each other.

I thought, "Why not structure it as a tutorial, mabey someone will find it useful?". So I did.

## The Implementations Get More Complex as I Go Down.
Yes, in general they get more complex. This however does not mean they are better.
My modifications get a bit ridicules near the end, Im a firm beleiver of [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it), just because they later implementations let you do more, you can always make the changes as you need them.

Implanting things just because you think you are going to need them, will result in a massive waist of time 90% of the time you aren't going to use it and it just bloats your code.
Wait until you need it then implement it.

## I Want More FizzBuzz
- Joel Grus wrote [Fizz Buzz in Tensorflow](tensorflow) and It's well worth a read
- If you need "Enterprise Quality" FizzBuzz check out [FizzBuzz Enterprise Edition](https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition) Its funny and sad at the same time.
